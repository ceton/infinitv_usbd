infinitv_usbd is the user space linux driver for the Ceton InfiniTV USB. It
opens any detected InfiniTV's, and reads from the MPEG endpoints (one per
tuner). It then injects it onto the network using the linux TUN
device so that the RTP/RTSP interface works seamlessly.

To build from a fresh clone run:
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
